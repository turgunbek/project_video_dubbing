But I'm also happy and honored to be up here and I think that it's great. I got to come, you know, before 10 or 20 or 30 years at pass and I'd had more agency in my career because maybe then I wouldn't tell the story of how I got my first job or maybe I wouldn't tell the story of how I paid for college, which seems so important right now.
