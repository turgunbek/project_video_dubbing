If the photographer is right there and the light is right there like a nice HMI and the client says, Cameron, we want a walking shot. Well then this light goes first, nice and long, this arm goes back, this arm goes forward, the head is at three quarters and you just go back and forth. You just do that and then you look back at your imaginary friends. 300, 400, 500 times. It will look something like this. Hopefully less awkward than that one in the middle. I don't know what happened there. Unfortunately after you've gone to school and you have a resume and you've done a few jobs, you can't say anything anymore.
