Okay, so the next question people always ask me is do you get free stuff? I do have too many aid in shields which I never get to wear except for earlier. But the free stuff that I get is the free stuff that I get in real life and that's what we don't like to talk about. I grew up in Cambridge and one time I went into a store and I forgot my money and they gave me the dress for free.
